# Node JS & Angular JS Quick Introduction
* Web systems comprises of Client (Browser) and Server. Mode of communication between Browser and Server is through HTTP. 
* HTTP request can be of two types. a) Ajax and b) Non Ajax. 
* Web pages are represented internally as DOM tree which is manipulated by Javascript/Angular.
* Using XML HTTP request (XHR), one can send ajax request to server and futher using the response, the existing DOM tree can be updated.
* Node JS runs at server side in one thread. So, we have to tasks in asynchronous mode.
* Node JS internally runs Google V8 Script Engine and provides 3 sets of interfaces. a) Console IO Module b) Socket IO Module c) HTTP Module.
* Express JS module has rich set of seperate javascript modules which can interact with Node JS.
* The general javascript object is represented as `@Component( { selector : "monthcalendar", template :"<b>MonthCalendar</b>", styles:[] })`.
  - Component represents Decorator
  - {...} represents JS object.
  - monthcalendar represents object name.
  - template represents html to be displayed.
  - styles represents css.
* Typescript is super set of javascript which is easy to develop and can be compiled to javascript.
